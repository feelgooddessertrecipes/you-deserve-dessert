                        Pies can be made with a variety of ingredients, including fruits, vegetables, nuts, and dairy
                        products. This diversity can provide a range of essential nutrients such as vitamins, minerals,
                        and antioxidants.
                        Fruit pies, especially those made with whole fruits and whole-grain crusts, can be a good source
                        of dietary fiber. Fiber is important for digestive health and can help regulate blood sugar
                        levels.
